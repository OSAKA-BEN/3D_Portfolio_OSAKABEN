        I am a French professional who previously worked as a project manager in the field of naval construction. While I enjoyed this work, I had always been interested in the world of computer programming, so I made the decision to transition to web development. I completed an intensive six-month training program and have since become a junior developer. <br />

        As someone who enjoys challenges and creativity, I am always eager to learn new things and come up with inventive solutions. I believe my background in project management has given me valuable skills that I can apply to my work as a developer, including strong communication and organization skills. Overall, I am excited to continue growing and expanding my skills as a developer in this exciting and dynamic field.
